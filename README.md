Web app for discovering upcoming musicians

The main premise was to create a platform where artists could sign in, upload their music (cloudinary) and create events with location added (google maps), and where users could search for artists, follow them and check the events created by artists.

This project was built with a big focus on the backend, no frontend technologies used.

Technologies: 
 - Javascript
 - Node.js
 - HTML
 - Express
 - Mongoose
 - MongoDB
 - Handlebars
 - SCSS
 - Bootstrap
 
API's:
 - Google maps
